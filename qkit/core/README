In the future, this folder will contain the new qkit core derived from qtlab.
The goal of this is to make qkit standalone.

Work in progress by AS and YS in the dedicated branch.

ToDo:
    + get the core starting with the qtlab init routine without pygtk
    - get rid of hardcoded locations in config.py and init/02_qtlab_start.py
    + remove gui and other unused code
    - test measurement
    - move source/plot_engines/qtgnuplot somewhere into qkit (used by qkit/measure/timedomain)
      or switch timedomain to qviewkit
    - include installation requirements into the qkit README (see old readme_012015.txt in comment to github issue)
    - rewrite the communication part
    - cleanup of unused code
    - reorganize folder structure
    - qtlab -> qkit_core (qt. -> qc.)
    - implement new basic gui showing the (measurement)status and settings
      based on qviewkit?
    - include start script/notebook into qkit

    YS: installed Python and qkit on dedicated test notebook
    YS: removed .pyc files, 3rd_party and instrument_plugins

10.05.2017
    YS: try to start the environment with the 000_qtlab_start notebook
        fail because of missing gobject from pygtk, which is 32bit

    YS: hardcoded working directory in source/lib/config.py adapted to new setup
    YS: remove gobject references in source/instrument.py
    YS: remove gobject references in source/lib/calltimer.py

11.05.2017
    YS: source/instrument.py: lib.network.object_sharer no longer imported
        class instrument previously inherited SharedGObject (from object_sharer)
        check which features were used besides emit!
    YS: remove gobject references in source/qtflow.py
        as with instrument.py: what else was used from SharedGObect?
        remove GTK references in source/qtflow.py
        mainloop commented since no events expected, seems to only wait for unused GTK gui
    YS: remove gobject references in source/instruments.py
        as with instrument.py: what else was used from SharedGObect?
    YS: source/qt.py: removed source/data.py and source/plot.py reference
        both are no longer used or replaced by qkit methods
    YS: init/02_qtlab_start.py: hardcoded config location adapted to new qtlab_core
        this should not be hardcoded!
    YS: remove gobject references in init/02_qtlab_start.py
        mainly object_sharer initialization
    YS: init/02_qtlab_start.py: removed source/data.py and source/plot.py reference 
    YS: deactivated gui in init/02_qtlab_start.py
    YS: remove gobject references in 98_started.py
        only object_sharer exit handler
    YS: source/lib/config.py: hardcoded directory adapted
        this should not be hardcoded!
    YS: init/00_lockfile.py: hardcoded directory adapted
        this should not be hardcoded!
    YS: userconfig.py: hardcoded directory adapted
        this should not be hardcoded!
    AS: 02_qtlab_start.py: Commented unnecessary qt.msleep in line 72

    YS: .gitignore
    YS: removed deprecated startscripts qtlab, qtlab.bat and ipython.bat
