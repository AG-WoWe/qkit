In the future, this folder will contain the new qkit core derived from qtlab.
The goal of this is to make qkit standalone.

Work in progress by ASt and YS in the dedicated branch.

ToDo:
    - get the core starting with the qtlab init routine without pygtk
    - remove gui and other unused code
    - test measurement
    - rewrite the communication part
    - reorganize folder structure
    - qtlab -> qkit_core (qt. -> qc.)
    - implement new basic gui showing the (measurement)status and settings
      based on qviewkit?

        class instrument previously inherited SharedGObject (from object_sharer)
        check which features were used besides emit!
    YS: remove gobject references in source/qtflow.py
        as with instrument.py: what else was used from SharedGObect?
