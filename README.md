Qkit -- a quantum measurement suite in python

### Features:
  * a collection of ipython notebooks for measurement and data analysis tasks.
  * hdf5 based data storage of 1,2 and 3 dimensional data, including a viewer.
  * classes for data fitting, e.g. of microwave resonator data. This includes also a robust circle fit algorithm.
  * extended and maintained drivers for various low frequency and microwave electronics.
  * based on qtlab, but large parts of the framework can be used independently.

### Platform:
  The qkit framework has been tested under windows and with limits under macos x and linux. 
  The gui requires h5py, qt and pyqtgraph, which work fine on these platforms.
 
### Requirements:
#### Basic:
  * An up to date python distribution, including the qt gui libs.  
    e.g.  anaconda python http://continuum.io/downloads  
          python xy http://pythonxynews.blogspot.de/
  * h5py http://www.h5py.org/
  * pyqtgraph is required by the viewer (qkit/gui/qviewkit) : http://www.pyqtgraph.org/


#### Full:
  * For a full installation, qtlab is required, e.g. from https://github.com/heeres/qtlab


### Installation:
  * copy the qkit archive to an apropriate place

#### Standalone:
  * add the qkit/qkit directory to your systems PYTHONPATH variable

#### with Qtlab:
  * add the qkit/qkit directory to your systems PYTHONPATH variable
  * change the path variables in Qtlab's userconfig.py apropriately, e.g.
    config['user_insdir']
    config['scriptdirs'] 
    It useful to add it to system path like this: sys.path.append('path_of_qkit_folder')
