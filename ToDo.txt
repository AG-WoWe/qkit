gui/plot/plot:
	* communication between closing a window and check mark
	* 1D view, not only color plot
	* save pics at measurement end automatically?
        * plot refresh resets set gui values
	* idea for dataset value_box: plot measured data against one axis of choice by constant (choosable) other parameters 
	  (similar to IV curve at specific 2nd mw_frequency and specific current)
	* continuous plot: measurement data vs one axis while sweeping the other parameters
	  (similar to IV curve while sweeping current)
	* "circle_fit plot": plotting data in complex plane?

storage/hdf_lib:
	* value_box: axis x, y and z; with decreasing "update frequency"

measurement/timedomain/measure_td:
	* add hdf data output and plotting
